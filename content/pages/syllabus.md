Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Topics
------

1.  Review of flow and transport equations, with particular emphasis on the energy equation and the role of viscous dissipation.
2.  Instability and transition.
3.  Fundamental concepts in turbulence; approaches to closure and turbulence modeling.
4.  Jets, wakes, etc. modeled via simple closure schemes. Scalar transport in free flows (temperature, concentration).
5.  Buoyant plumes, transient thermals, etc.
6.  Turbulent flow over walls: general near-wall scaling laws; flows in pipes, channels, etc.
7.  Boundary layers.
8.  Transient dispersion in laminar and turbulent shear flows (Taylor dispersion).
9.  Turbulence models and their application.
10.  Additional topics.

Grading
-------

The final grade is based on performance in:

*   Homework Problems
*   Midterm Quiz (take-home)
*   Individual Project
*   Take-home Final Exam
